K8s has 3 components in worker nodes

1. Kubelet: Responsible for the creation of the pod and ensures that the pod is always running and if not takes the necessary action.
2. Kube-proxy: Responsible for generating the IP addresses or load balancing (Uses IP tables in Linux m/c)
3. Container runtime: Responsible to run the container.

--> Master node/Control plane
1. API server- Who will decide on which node pod needs to be created, it is a core component which deals when multiple users are giving request. Component which basically 
exposes your K8s.
2. Scheduler- Responsible to schedule resources on K8s. API server decides schedules executes.
3. etcd- is a key-value store. Helps to restore the cluster
4. Controler manager- K8s supports auro scaling so it has to have some components like replica set.
5. Cloud control manager- K8s can run on cloud. There is a request to create LB or S3. For this K8s needs to convert this request to work on cloud.
