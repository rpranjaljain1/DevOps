Issues with Docker

--->>Single host nature:
Containers are ephemeral in nature-->containers have short life-->Since docker is hosted on a single host some containers might killed due to lack of memory resources.
--->>Auto healing
If somebody kills the container it will not start again. There are 100s of reasons your container can go down.
--->>Auto scaling
Docker does not support auto-healing.
--->>Does not support any enterprise-level support:
The application should have firewall support, LB, API gateways, and an auto scaler.

Solution with K8s
--->>>Host- by default k8s is a cluster.
cluster is basically a group of nodes. we create one master node and a slave node. it has multi-node architecture, immediately it will host a pod in different host.
--->>>Auto scaling- Go to YAML file and edit it to increase from 1 to 10, this is manual. 
horizontal pod auto scaling supports automatic auto scaling.. if load increases deploy more containers.
--->>>Auto healing- K8s either controls or fix the damage. Even before a container goes down k8s starts healing. whenever k8 gets signal about some issue 
in container it deploys a new container.
--->>>Enterprise nature- K8s is an enterprise-level orchestration platform. Docker independently never used in produvtions.
