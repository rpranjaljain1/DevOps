Issues with Docker

--->>Single host nature:
Containers are ephemeral in nature-->containers have short life-->Since docker is hosted on a single host some containers might killed due to lack of memory resources.
--->>Auto healing
If somebody kills the container it will not start again. There are 100s of reasons your container can go down.
--->>Auto scaling
Docker does not supports auto healing.
